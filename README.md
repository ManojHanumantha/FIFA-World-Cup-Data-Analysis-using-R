A Comprehensive Data Analysis of the FIFA World Cup

# Football Match Outcome Prediction

This project aims to predict the outcome of football matches using machine learning techniques and analysis of various datasets related to football tournaments, teams, players, and host countries.

## Overview

In this project, we combine multiple datasets containing information about football matches, players, teams, and host countries. We then perform both quantitative and qualitative analysis to gain insights into factors influencing match outcomes. The project includes the following components:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing: We load and preprocess datasets to create a unified dataset for analysis.
- Quantitative Analysis: We use a regression model to predict the margin of victory in football matches based on team attributes and tournament details.
- Qualitative Analysis: We extract relevant text for analysis and explore qualitative factors affecting match outcomes.
- Geographical Analysis: We visualize the geographical distribution of matches using Leaflet to gain insights into match locations.
- Interactive Data Visualizations: We create interactive visualizations using Plotly to explore trends and patterns in the data.
